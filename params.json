{"name":"Underwater Virtual Reality Project","tagline":"Virada Long and Erian Vazquez","body":"## Welcome to our virtual reality project page. \r\nThis is the project page of Virada Long and Erian Vazquez. We've created an underwater virtual reality experience that can be seen through the Google Cardboard. The engine used was Unity and many free to use assets were utilized in the making of this project.\r\n\r\nThe project consists of two scenes, the first made by Erian Vazquez and the second by Virada Long. The first scene is of two sunken pirate ships, the aftermath of a battle fought long ago over gold and treasure. The scene sets you, a diver in the present day, to explore the ruins of the two enemy pirate ships and find the coveted treasure. Upon coming across the treasure, the lid opens and you're transported to the next scene, your goal accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn the next scene, you find yourself deep underwater, facing a steep, subaquatic cliff. You drop your flashlight and watch it fall down into the murky depths. The goal now is to retrieve your flashlight. As you dive deeper, strange sounds, faint and faraway at first, begin to grow louder and surround you. Something large floats overhead. The scene ends once you find your flashlight. \r\n\r\nThe world under the sea is a compelling mystery. We're unable to survive under the water, but there are still some brave that the depths to explore, learn, and even just to feel a sense of wonder at how vast the ocean is. Our project was created to explore these feelings. Diving around sunken ships and deep sea diving are both viable activities in real life, however both also present very real dangers. With virtual reality, you can get a sense of what being engulfed in the ocean feels like. \r\n\r\n## Our Project in Action\r\n//embed youtube video here\r\n\r\n### Project Link\r\n[Underwater Virtual Reality Project] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz79xd1hc9D3MkdILXMtZ0VXak0/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* Underwater world and effects by Konstantin Dvornik\r\n  * http://kostiantyn-dvornik.blogspot.com/2013/05/unity-worlds-coolest-tutorial-about.html\r\n* Detailed Pirate Ship with Ocean 3d modeal by thethunk \r\n  * http://tf3dm.com/3d-model/detailed-pirate-ship-with-ocean-67779.html\r\n* Ship 3D Model by Boris\r\n  * http://archive3d.net/?a=download&id=038e4598\r\n* Treasure Chest - Epic by BITGEM\r\n  * https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3930\r\n* Rock and Boulders 2 by Manufactura K4\r\n  * https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/6947\r\n* Scuba Diver Breathing Underwater by gr8sfx's\r\n  * http://www.freesfx.co.uk/sfx/scuba\r\n* humpback whale 2 by Universal-Soundbank\r\n  * http://eng.universal-soundbank.com/whales.htm\r\n* Underwater Floor Effects by bgivenb\r\n  * http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/underwater-environment-breakdown.265543/\r\n* Swimming Script by GameVortex\r\n  * http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/616195/how-to-make-an-object-go-the-direction-it-is-facin.html\r\n* Head Direction Script by dolims\r\n  * http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/how-to-do-head-based-steering.311305/\r\n* Yughues Free Bushes by Nobiax/Yughues\r\n  * https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13168\r\n* Building a Google Cardboard VR App in Unity by Patrick Catanzariti\r\n  * http://www.sitepoint.com/building-a-google-cardboard-vr-app-in-unity/\r\n* SciFi Handlight Free by Hit Jones\r\n  * https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/53498\r\n* iTween and iTween Visual Path Editor by Bob Berkebile\r\n  * http://www.itween.pixelplacement.com/index.php\r\n* iTween Editor by Vortex Game Studios LTDA ME\r\n  * https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/50101\r\n* Humpback Whale by janpec \r\n  * https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3547\r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
